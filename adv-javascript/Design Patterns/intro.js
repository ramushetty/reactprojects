// // Design patterns in JavaScript, much like in other programming languages, are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
// They are templates or guidelines for how to solve a particular problem that can be used in many different situations. Using design patterns can help to 
// make code more robust, clean, and efficient. Some of the most commonly used design patterns in JavaScript include:

// // Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is often used for managing global states.

// // Module Pattern: Encapsulates a group of related functions, variables, and objects into a single unit or module. This pattern helps in organizing 
// code and avoiding namespace pollution.

// // Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated 
// automatically. This is particularly useful in maintaining consistency between related objects without making classes tightly coupled.

// // Prototype Pattern: Used for creating objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning. It is a form of prototype-based inheritance 
// where you create objects by cloning an existing object.

// // Factory Pattern: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refers to the newly created object through a common 
// interface. This pattern is useful when the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

// // Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queue or log 
// requests, and support undoable operations.

// // Decorator Pattern: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other 
// objects from the same class.

// // Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern lets the algorithm
//  vary independently from clients that use it.

// // Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It involves creating a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem
//  easier to use.

// // Mediator Pattern: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring 
// to each other explicitly.

// // Each pattern serves a specific purpose and can be adapted to fit a particular context in JavaScript programming. Understanding these patterns 
// can be a huge asset in designing robust and maintainable JavaScript applications.



// Design patterns are more about the concept and the solution to a problem rather than the specific implementation details. 
// Whether you use classes, functions, or object literals depends on your specific use case and personal or project coding standards.
//  JavaScript's flexibility allows for a variety of implementations for these patterns.
