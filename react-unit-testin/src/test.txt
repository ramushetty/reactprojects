Simple Component Rendering

Test if a component renders without crashing.
Check if it renders the correct content.


Component with Props

Test if the component correctly displays passed props.
Handle different prop types and values.

Component with State

Test state changes and corresponding UI updates.
Simulate events to trigger state changes.

Event Handling

Simulate user events (clicks, input) and test the outcomes.
Ensure callbacks are called when expected.


Asynchronous Data

Mock API calls and test loading, success, and error states.
Use async and await in tests for asynchronous functions.


Snapshot Testing

Create snapshots to test if the UI does not change unexpectedly.
Update snapshots when intentional changes are made.
